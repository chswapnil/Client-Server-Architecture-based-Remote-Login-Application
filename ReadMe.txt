Purpose of the Project:
To engineer a client server architecture based application with concurrent server and implement remote login

Name of the source code files:
1.) mainserver.c // Server file which is suppose to be executed by the user
2.) server.c // File which is executed by the mainserver.c program
3.) mainclient.c // Client file which is suppose to be executed by the user
4.) client.c // File which is executed by the mainclient.c program

Steps to run the code...
1.)Type "make" to compile the file in the terminal
2.) Server and client are suppose to be running on the LAN network
3.) Execute the mainserver.c first by typing "./mainserver" in one terminal
4.) Execute the mainclient.c by typing "./mainclient" in another terminal
5.) Start giving command such as "pwd","cd","ls","quit" and "do nothing"
6.) You can run multiple in different machine too.
